Welcome to my website!<br><br>

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/" target="_blank">Paris School of Economics (PSE)</a>. My research interests are mainly in family, labor and gender economics. I completed my masterâ€™s and bachelor's degrees at University Carlos III of Madrid.<br><br>

Previously, I worked as a Research Analyst at the European Central Bank at DG Economics and DG Research. I also completed a pre-doc at the Barcelona School of Economics/UPF and worked as a Research Assistant at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the Bank of Spain.<br><br>
