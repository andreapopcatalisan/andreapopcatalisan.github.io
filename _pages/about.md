Welcome to my website!<br><br>

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/" target="_blank">Paris School of Economics (PSE)</a>.  I completed my master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Economics at <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/inicio" target="_blank">University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M)</a>. My research interests are mainly in family, health and gender economics. <br><br>

Previously, I worked as a Research Analyst at the European Central Bank in DG Economics and DG Research. I also completed a pre-doc at the Barcelona School of Economics & UPF and a research internship at the Bank of Spain.<br><br>
