Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/). My research interests are mainly in family, labor and gender economics. I completed my masterâ€™s and bachelor's degrees at University Carlos III of Madrid. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Analyst at the European Central Bank at DG Economics and DG Research. I also completed a pre-doc at the Barcelona School of Economics/UPF and worked as a Research Assistant at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the Bank of Spain.

You can find my [CV](https://andreapopcatalisan.github.io/assets/CV_APC.pdf) here and learn more about my [research](https://andreapopcatalisan.github.io/research/) here.
